# Groovie - The Grannie Movie Request Interface

Groovie is a simple web application that allows a user to log in, search for movies using TMDB API, and add search results to a personal list of requests. It was created to help simplify the process of my Grandma and Mother-in-Law requesting me to move films from my collection to their media centers.

## Built With

* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Node.js Web Framework
* [MongoDB](mongodb.com) - NoSQL Database
* [TMDB API](www.tmdb.com) - Used to populate search results
